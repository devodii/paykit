# Custom Provider Integration

Create a custom provider that works with PayKit's React SDK and other services.

## Getting Started

1. Copy this folder to your project
2. Choose the right implementation:
   - `/with-sdk` - If your provider has an official SDK
   - `/without-sdk` - If you need to call APIs manually
3. Implement your provider logic
4. Export it like any other PayKit provider

That's it.
