# Welcome to PayKit

PayKit was built to solve a fundamental problem: switching payment providers shouldn't require rewriting your entire payment flow. Whether you're moving to a new region, need better tax rates, or want to optimize for specific payment methods, changing providers often means rebuilding subscriptions, webhooks, and checkout flows from scratch.

PayKit provides a unified interface that abstracts away provider-specific implementations, allowing you to switch between Stripe, Polar, Gumroad, and other providers without touching your business logic.

## Why PayKit?

Payment providers excel at different things. Stripe dominates in North America, Polar specializes in creator subscriptions, and Gumroad leads in digital product sales. But switching between them means rewriting your payment infrastructure each time.

PayKit standardizes the interface across providers. Your subscription logic, webhook handlers, and checkout flows work unchanged regardless of which provider you choose. When you need to switch for regional compliance, better rates, or new features, you simply change the provider configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @paykit-sdk/core @paykit-sdk/stripe
```

```typescript
import { PayKit } from '@paykit-sdk/core';
import { stripe } from '@paykit-sdk/stripe';

const provider = stripe();
const paykit = new PayKit(provider);

const checkout = await paykit.checkouts.create({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  item_id: 'price_123',
  session_type: 'one_time',
  metadata: { plan: 'pro' },
});
```
